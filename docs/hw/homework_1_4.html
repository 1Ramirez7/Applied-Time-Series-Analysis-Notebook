<p>The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.</p>
<p>Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.</p>

<p>The data consist of the daily high for the Rexburg airport so each observation reflects the highest fahrenheit temperature recorded at the Rexburg airport. The data is giving daily from 1999/01/02 to 2023/12/20. Data is pretty straight forward.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The Rexburg Daily Temperature series displays a consistent seasonal pattern throughout the period observed, which is a key for an additive model where seasonal fluctuations are stable and do not vary in magnitude over time. The temperature data does not exhibit a multiplicative trend where seasonal variations would proportionally increase or decrease as the level of the series changes. Instead, the variations around the trend appear consistent over time, suggesting that the additive model, where seasonal effects are assumed to be constant through the series, is more appropriate.</p>
<p>The deterministic nature of the trend in the temperature data supports the use of an additive model. This model assumes that the components of the series (trend, seasonality, and randomness) can be linearly added or subtracted to model or decompose the series. Since there is no evidence of increasing variability with temperature values, a characteristic more aligned with multiplicative models. The additive assumption holds more relevance. This allows for clearer interpretation and more accurate seasonal adjustment of the data.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In the Classical decomposition, the error component is determined by removing trend and seasonal from the original time series, which is the same as the normal additive random component we do in this example. Iâ€™m honestly confused on this part because replicating some of the other random series we did in class, and also doing the multiplicative random graph made almost no difference. The changes were hard to see, but Iâ€™m obviously missing the idea of knowing the difference between the three and how we get them</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \text{random component} = x_t - \hat m_t - \bar s_t
\]</span></p>
<p>Next is personal notes for the random component variables.</p>
<p>x is the monthly mean of the Rexburg temperature highs. m_hat is the monthly centered moving average, and s_hat is the seasonally adjusted mean for each month. X takes the mean of all observations for the given month (t). m_hat uses the previous six and next six observations (months), this is done to better capture seasonality in the months, because some seasons can be colder than the same season the previous year. Doing the CMA will smooth out the trend and make the time series analysis more accurate. Not using the CMA (using x_t) can cause the variance to spike during abnormal seasons and can falsely point to better doing a multiplicative model. s_bar takes the mean of all unique months, so with this data, s_bar returns 12 observations, one for each month. s_bar helps in finding how random the seasons are. So when a season is colder than usual, it will be below the s_bar value for that month, and if that month is also colder than the CMA for the given month, then it will result in a higher random value. Having the CMA and s_bar months subtracted from the actual normal mean (x) paints a better picture if that was a normal month of January by taking into account the season and means of all Januarys. In an additive model, the months have a pattern and thatâ€™s why we use a boxplot. So the seasonality is deterministic, so you can take January and February. A multiplicative model has either an increasing or decreasing trend, so plugging in those same two months a few years later will not work out. So, in essence, the variance moves out of the pattern over time for multiplicative, which makes it stochastic, but the variance stays deterministic because the variance stays constant or within the same seasonality over time.</p>
