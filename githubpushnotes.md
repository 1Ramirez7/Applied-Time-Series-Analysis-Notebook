Github Push notes

#6 I added the index timeseries in this push

- The site_libs folder was created with this push
    - So if the timeseries folder is remove, more than likely this folder is not needed.


#17 transferring files from raw repo
- hw 1.5 had a classical decomposition table not work due to the common library issue.
- I just comment that part of the code to fix later

#18 - transferring more files
- hw 3.3 has the mult classical forecast models that take 7 minutes to run
    - I excluded the last two code chunks for faster rendering but can add later
