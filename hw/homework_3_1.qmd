# Questions

## Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

### a) Construction Equipment Manufacturing Orders and Shipments

<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1f4dN>

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
Both x (ord) and y (ship) variables are increasing over time. So a multiplicative classical decomposition model is best. The data is collected monthly and the unit of analysis is in thousands of dollars. The data is collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and is used to measure the value of new orders and shipments for construction equipment manufacturing. The observations represent the total value of new orders and shipments in thousands of dollars for each month.

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: time series plot of both variables
# this is code for hw 3-1

# this code is same as the dfx2 & dfy2 code
df1 <- df1 |>
  mutate(index = tsibble::yearmonth(date)) |> # 3.1
  as_tsibble(index = index) |>
  select(index, date, x, y)



autoplot(df1, .vars = x) +
  geom_line(data = df1, aes(x = index, y = y), color = "#E69F00") +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "New orders & Value of Equip",
    title = "Time Series of Construction Equip: New Orders & Equipment"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
:::

#### Figure: CCF plot of random component of New Orders and Equipment.

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: figure 4 of lesson 3-1
df11 <- model(df1, feasts::classical_decomposition(x)) |>
  components() |>
  select(index, random) |>
  rename(x_random = random)

df111 <- model(df1, feasts::classical_decomposition(y)) |>
    components() |>
  select(index, random) |>
  rename(y_random = random)

random_joint <- df11 |>
  right_join(df111, by = join_by(index))

autoplot(random_joint, .vars = x_random) +
  geom_line(data = random_joint, aes(x = index, y = y_random), color = "#E69F00") +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "Random Component (Thousands)",
    title = "Random Component",
    subtitle = "Construction Equip: New Orders & Value of Shipmentfor Construction Equipment"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )

```

## Question 2 - Construction Equipment Manufacturing: Graphical Analysis (15 points)

### a) Please plot a correlogram of the random components of the New Orders and Value of Shipments for the Construction Equipment Manufacturing data. Include both plots in the same illustration as exemplified in the Figure 5 of Chapter 3 Lesson 1.

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: ACF for the random components new orders&equipment

x_random <- ACF(random_joint, y = x_random) |> autoplot() +
    labs(title = "ACF of Random Component of New Orders Over Time")
y_random <- ACF(random_joint, y = y_random) |> autoplot() +
    labs(title = "ACF of Random Component of Equipment Over Time")
x_random / y_random
```

### b) Interpret and analyze the correlogram of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
Observing the correlogram patterns over time reveals a prominent cyclical or seasonal patterns. Both New Orders and Shipments random components show a decaying pattern, this could suggest autoregressive characteristics or lingering seasonal influences not fully removed by decomposition, but new orders looks to have more peaks and downs. New orders shows more persistent peaks or valleys than the other, indicating differing sensitivities of New Orders and Shipments to economic or seasonal factors over time. Overall, this analysis helps in identifying whether fluctuations in each seriesâ€™ random component are synchronized or vary independently across the observed dates.
:::

## Question 3 - Construction Equipment Manufacturing: Cross-correlation (30 points)

### a) Please plot a cross-correlogram of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: cross-correlogram of x and y


random_joint %>%
  CCF(y = y_random, x = x_random) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "CCF for Random Component of Construction Equipment\nManufacturing Orders (x) and Shipments (y)",
    subtitle = ""
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )
```
:::

### b) Please interpret the cross-correlogram of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series. Include descriptions of the statistical and practical significance of the results.

```{r, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Converts a dataframe to char and rounds the values to a specified number of places
convert_df_to_char <- function(df, decimals = 3) {
  out_df <- df |>
    as.data.frame() |>
    mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits=decimals) |>
    mutate(across(everything(), as.character))
  return(out_df)
}
display_table <- function(df, min_col_width = "0in") {
  df |>
    knitr::kable(format = "html", align='ccccccccccccccccc', escape = FALSE, width = NA, row.names = FALSE) |>
    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, "striped") |>
    column_spec(1:ncol(df), width_min = min_col_width)
}

temp_df <- random_joint |>
  CCF(y = y_random, x = x_random) |>
  filter(lag <= 12 & lag >= -12) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  convert_df_to_char(3) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = lag, values_from = ccf) |>
  mutate(lag = "ccf")

lag12 <- temp_df |>
  dplyr::select(lag, "-12M":"0M") 

lead12 <- temp_df |>
  dplyr::select(lag, "0M":"12M") 
```

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
The correlogram analysis of the New Orders and Value of Shipments series reveals certain underlying temporal relationships. Positive correlations at lags 0M and 1M (0.229 and 0.059) suggest that recent monthly values of New Orders are closely aligned with those of Shipments, indicating a strong association. As the lag increases, the correlation values fluctuate, with both positive and negative shifts, suggesting possible seasonality or periodic variations. Notably, there is a stronger positive correlation up to around lag 2M, after which correlations decline, pointing to diminishing linear dependence over time. This pattern may imply that, while New Orders and Shipments align in short periods, their association weakens over extended lags, possibly due to external economic factors affecting manufacturing demand and supply differently over time.
