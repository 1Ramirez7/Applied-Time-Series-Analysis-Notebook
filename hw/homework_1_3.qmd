## Questions

### Question 1 - Estimating the Trend: Centered Moving Average (10 points)

Please plot the US Unemployment time series and superimpose the centered moving average series $\hat{m}_{t}$ in the same graph. Don't use an R command; rather, do it by coding $\hat{m}_{t}$ like in Chapter 1: Lesson 3. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.

### Question 2 - Seasonal Averages: Side-by-Side Box Plots by Month (10 points)

Please create a box plot to illustrate the monthly averages in the US Unemployment time series. Use the appropriate axis labels, units, and captions.

# Please provide your code here
# Box plot of monthly averages in the US Unemployment time series

# Prepare Data: Converts the date column to month names and categorizes them as factors.
unemp_rate_tsibble <- unemp_rate_tsibble %>%
  mutate(month = factor(format(date, "%m"), labels = month.name))

# Create Boxplot: Initializes a boxplot with months on the x-axis and unemployment rates on the y-axis, excluding individual data points.
# Adjust Layout: Adds a title and labels to the plot for clarity and presentation.
p <- plot_ly(unemp_rate_tsibble, x = ~month, y = ~value, type = 'box', boxpoints = FALSE) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Boxplots of US Unemployment Rate by Month",
    xaxis = list(title = "Month"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Unemployment Rate (%)")
  )

### Question 3 - Seasonal Averages: Analysis (20 points)

##### a) Describe the seasonality of the US unemployment time series. Comment on the series' periods of highest and lowest unemployment. Are there any notable outliers?

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
January, February, and June have the highest unemployment in general. January and February have high unemployment because it's after the holiday rush, so many employers let go of their seasonal help. I can see many retailers doing most of the layoffs, but also, many local economies slow down during winter. The spike in unemployment in June can be link to end of school year, so many high school and college graduates are looking for employment, which can lead to a rise in unemployment.

October and August had the lowest minimum unemployment rate of 2.4%. October had the lowest Q1 unemployment rate of 3.85%. January had the highest median unemployment rate of 6.25%. February had the highest Q3 unemployment rate of 7.5%. April had the highest maximum unemployment rate of all months, with an unemployment rate of 14.4%.

The highest outliers occurred during the years 1982-1983, 2009-2011, and 2020(14.4%). These years were marked by economic downturns, so it is obvious why they were the highest.
:::

##### b) Please explain the patterns you found. Include information from your prior research on the series.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
This research was great in introducing us to the CMA and its importance. Below is a screenshot with the annual mean superimposed on the left and the Monthly US unemployment Rate with CMA on the right. The line in the plot between 2000 and 2020 is for the year 2010. We can see that the annual mean hits its high right after 2010, but on the CMA orange line, that high happened during December 2009. When looking at average data over time using the normal mean, we would have assumed 2010 had high unemployment, which it did, but the peak happened at the end of 2009. We can also see how the spike in 2020 is lower on the annual mean. Although these patterns are from visuals, by doing further research into the numbers, we will find obvious differences in the data. This teaches me that simply doing averages can cause misunderstandings in data.
