## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

**Nominal Gross Domestic Product - United States**

### Question 3 - US Real GDP (25 points)

Nominal GDP measures the market value of US output. Because market prices change over time, inflation affects the series. Real GDP is an output measure that keeps prices constant at a point in time, which eliminates the effect of inflation.

In homework 2.1 you learned about the output gap, which is a measure of business cycles. In order to estimate the output gap we need some measure of potential GDP, that is, a series that smoothes-out the cycles in the real GDP series. We can do that by choosing the smoothing parameters of the H-W algorithm to capture only the long run path of the economy. The US Congressional Budget Office calculates a series for [US Real Potential GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT), please refer to it for the questions that follow.

#### a) Please use H-W to smooth the US Real GDP series to obtain an estimate of US Potential GDP.
