# .yml code to fix

2.   back-to-top-navigation: true 
    * This is my original code and it works normally.
    * Time series uses this one: page-navigation: true 
      * When I use the time series I started getting this warning message
        * [WARNING] Could not fetch resource ../projects/project2.html
        * What is the difference between the two?
        

# using Definitons or footnotes

 The following is working code to use footnotes but works great for definitions. Obviously not the best way to reference def, but this seems like a simple and straight forward process. Seems super static so it wont take long to load as well.

White noise[^1]

[^1]: defintion here


# Streamline code

chapter_3_overview_code_draft.qmd is streamline

- Edits to variables happen in first code chunk and qmd runs all code for that chapter.

- May need to data frame set according to data


# color definitions 

so far I'm using the color purple for like definitions or the main topic of that paragraph but mostly definitions or explaining of a variable. 


I should make like a color code for the different colors I use.

- purple: purple is assign for variables or important subjects that are been define and or main topic of that paragraph and or just need to stand out. 

Pink: Pink will be assign to words that I don't know the definition and or meaning, and or words that need a definition link to them. This will help as I know that I can add the definition link later if I don't do it then
