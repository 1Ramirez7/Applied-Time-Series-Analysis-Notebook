This page is to include pontential ideas to do for resources, tools, and ideas for time series



# .yml code to fix

1. _quarto.yml code. the sidebar code is different from time series and mine
    * time series sidebar does not appear on the side while my does. theme looks different
    * I think it just has to do w/ the theme
    
2.   back-to-top-navigation: true 
    * This is my original code and it works normally.
    * Time series uses this one: page-navigation: true 
      * When I use the time series I started getting this warning message
        * [WARNING] Could not fetch resource ../projects/project2.html
        * What is the difference between the two?
