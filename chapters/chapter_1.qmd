This is the overview of the chapter 4. I will add info from the index file here. I will filter from there to what will go here.
My goal is to first have the website have a map of the concepts in time series. I want to first avoid doing it by chapters since it seperates topics and limit my learning to that lesson. Bigger picture first.
