Obviously not the best way to reference def, but this seems like a simple and straight forward process. Seems super static so it wont take long to load as well.\n\nWhite noise[^1]\n\n[^1]: White noise consists of independent, identically distributed variables with mean 0, finite constant variance, and no correlation, representing purely random fluctuations over time.\n\n\n# Streamline code\n\nchapter_3_overview_code_draft.qmd is streamline\n\n- Edits to variables happen in first code chunk and qmd runs all code for that chapter.\n\n- May need to data frame set according to data\n\n\n# color definitions \n\nso far I'm using the color purple for like definitions or the main topic of that paragraph but mostly definitions or explaining of a variable. \n\n\nI should make like a color code for the different colors I use.\n\n- purple: purple is assign for variables or important subjects that are been define and or main topic of that paragraph and or just need to stand out. \n\nPink: Pink will be assign to words that I don't know the definition and or meaning, and or words that need a definition link to them. This will help as I know that I can add the definition link later if I don't do it then\n\n\n\n\n# add a concerns/doubs?\n\nthinking of having a place where I can have my doubts and concerns, but maybe I can just do github issues for this since once it gets solve it will no longer be needed. doing issues will have more urgency to solve the problem.\nok, I'm going to do issues\n\n\n\n\n\n#

prominent peak.\n\n- Bimodal: A sampling distribution with two distinct peaks.\n\n- Multimodal: A sampling distribution with more than two peaks.\n\n- Uniform: In a uniform distribution, every value within a specified range has an equal probability of occurring, creating a flat horizontal line when visualized on a graph.\n\nSkewness:\n\n- Positive Skewness (Right Skewed): The tail of the distribution extends further to the right side, meaning there are a few very high values compared to the majority of lower values.\n\n- Negative Skewness (Left Skewed): The tail of the distribution extends further to the left side, indicating a few very low values compared to most higher values.\n\n- Zero Skewness (Symmetrical): The distribution is balanced with the left and right sides mirroring each other. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Unimodal\nggplot(data.frame(x = rnorm(1000)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.5)
