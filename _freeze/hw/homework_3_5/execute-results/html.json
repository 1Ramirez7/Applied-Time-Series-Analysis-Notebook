You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.\n\nPlease research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.\n\n**Nominal Gross Domestic Product - United States**\n\n<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NA000334Q>\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- left_join(ngdp1, rgdp1, by = c(\"yquarter\" = \"yq\")) |> # joined df\n  select(yquarter, gdp_millions, GDPC1)\n\ndf <- df |>\n    rename(\n        index = yquarter  # rename `yquarter` to `index`\n    ) |>\n    mutate(\n        GDPC1 = as.numeric(GDPC1),\n        gdp_millions = as.numeric(gdp_millions)\n    ) |>\n    as_tsibble(index = index)  # set `index` as the tsibble index\n\nmax_GDPC1 <- max(df$GDPC1, na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_gdp_millions <- max(df$gdp_millions, na.rm = TRUE)\ndf <- df %>%\n    mutate(scaled_gdp_millions = gdp_millions / max_gdp_millions * max_GDPC1)\n\n# Plot with dual y-axes\nggplot(df, aes(x = index)) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = GDPC1, color = \"GDPC1\")) +\n    geom_line(aes(y = scaled_gdp_millions, color = \"gdp_millions\")) +  # Use scaled gdp_millions for plotting\n    scale_y_continuous(\n        name = \"GDPC1\",\n        sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * max_gdp_millions / max_GDPC1, name = \"gdp_millions\")  # Secondary axis transformation\n    ) +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"GDPC1\" = \"blue\", \"gdp_millions\" = \"red\")) +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n    labs(color = \"Legend\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework_3_5_files/figure-html/resource 3-2 mirror-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacf_appr <- ACF(df, y = GDPC1) |> autoplot() + # rename df\n    labs(title = \"GDPC1\")\nacf_act <- ACF(df, y = gdp_millions) |> autoplot() +\n    labs(title = \"gdp_millions\")\njoint_ccf_plot <- df |>\n  CCF(y = GDPC1, x = gdp_millions) |> autoplot() +\n  labs(title = \"CCF Plot\")\n(acf_appr + acf_act) / joint_ccf_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework_3_5_files/figure-html/resource 3-2 mirror-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nCCF(df, GDPC1, gdp_millions)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tsibble: 43 x 2 [1Q]\n        lag   ccf\n   <cf_lag> <dbl>\n 1     -21Q 0.711\n 2     -20Q 0.722\n 3     -19Q 0.733\n 4     -18Q 0.745\n 5     -17Q 0.757\n 6     -16Q 0.769\n 7     -15Q 0.780\n 8     -14Q 0.790\n 9     -13Q 0.801\n10     -12Q 0.813\n# â„¹ 33 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit trend models to the data\n# Fit trend models to the data\napp_model <- df %>%\n    model(trend_model = TSLM(GDPC1 ~ trend()))\n\nact_model <- df %>%\n    model(trend_model = TSLM(gdp_millions ~ trend()))\n\n# Extract the fitted values and residuals using augment()\napp_decompose <- app_model %>%\n    augment() %>%\n    select(index, GDPC1, trend = .fitted, remainder = .resid)\n\nact_decompose <- act_model %>%\n    augment() %>%\n    select(index, gdp_millions, trend = .fitted, remainder = .resid)\n\n# Plot the ACF of the remainder components\napp_random <- ACF(app_decompose, remainder) %>% autoplot() +\n    labs(title = \"ACF of GDPC1 Remainder\")\n\nact_random <- ACF(act_decompose, remainder) %>% autoplot() +\n    labs(title = \"ACF of gdp_millions Remainder\")\n\n# Merge the remainder components for cross-correlation analysis\nrandom_decompose <- app_decompose %>%\n    select(index, random_app = remainder) %>%\n    left_join(\n        act_decompose %>% select(index, random_act = remainder),\n        by = \"index\"\n    )\n\n# Plot the cross-correlation function between the remainder components\njoint_ccf_random <- random_decompose %>%\n    CCF(y = random_app, x = random_act) %>%\n    autoplot() +\n    labs(title = \"CCF between GDPC1 and gdp_millions Remainders\")\n\n# Display the plots\nlibrary(patchwork)\n(app_random + act_random) / joint_ccf_random\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework_3_5_files/figure-html/resource 3-2 mirror-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n**Real Gross Domestic Product - United States**\n\n<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1>\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\n<!-- Delete this and put your answer here.

Please explain.\n\n### Question 3 - US Real GDP (25 points)\n\nNominal GDP measures the market value of US output. Because market prices change over time, inflation affects the series. Real GDP is an output measure that keeps prices constant at a point in time, which eliminates the effect of inflation.\n\nIn homework 2.1 you learned about the output gap, which is a measure of business cycles. In order to estimate the output gap we need some measure of potential GDP, that is, a series that smoothes-out the cycles in the real GDP series. We can do that by choosing the smoothing parameters of the H-W algorithm to capture only the long run path of the economy. The US Congressional Budget Office calculates a series for [US Real Potential GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT), please refer to it for the questions that follow.\n\n#### a) Please use H-W to smooth the US Real GDP series to obtain an estimate of US Potential GDP.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Delete this and put your answer here.
