Justify your choice.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\nThe parameters chosen were alpha = 0.1429622 and alpha = 0.2 in two models, with beta = 0 and no seasonality (gamma) excluded, to balance trend sensitivity without overreacting to short-term changes. The moderate alpha values capture recent trends in unemployment while maintaining stability, and beta = 0 prevents fluctuating trend updates. Optimized by minimizing short-term forecast error (average mean squared error), these settings are well-suited for smoothing non-seasonal economic data like unemployment rates.\n:::\n\n##### c) Please plot the Holt-Winters forecast of the series for the next 24 months superimposed against the original series.

I can see how the random component handles the random events a little better the the additive which will make sense since the data can have a downward or upward trend for certain time periods.

Please access the latest data [HERE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATENSA). Please don't look at it until you have reached this point in the homework. Compare your forecasting work with with the actual realization of the series. What lessons about forecasting can you learn from the occurrence of [Gray Rhino](https://chatgpt.com/share/6712c9e5-4f58-8005-888d-acae9895bd05) events like a pandemic?\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\nComparing the forecasted unemployment rates with the actual post-2019 data highlights that the Holt-Winters model could not anticipate the sharp rise in unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Gray Rhino event. This underscores that traditional forecasting models, which rely on historical trends, are limited in predicting sudden, large disruptions. Such events emphasize the need for adaptive models that account for potential shocks in economic data.\n:::\n\n### Rubric\n\n|  |  |  |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Criteria** | **Mastery (10)** | **Incomplete (0)** |\n| **Question 1a: HW Smoothing** | Demonstrate the implementation of the Holt-Winters smoothing method in R, providing well-commented code that clearly explains each step of the algorithm.
