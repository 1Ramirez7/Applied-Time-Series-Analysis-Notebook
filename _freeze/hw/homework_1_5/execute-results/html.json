You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.\n\nPlease research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.\n\n#### a) **Vessels Cleared in Foreign Trade for United States**\n\n<https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M03022USM583NNBR>\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\nThe Vessels data gives the monthly number of vessels (in thousands) cleared in Foreign Trade for the United States. The plot below plots every month from January 1901 to September 1940. Base on the plot we can observe the number of vessels cleared each month was increasing over time. We can see that the number of vessels cleared monthly hit a decline in growth during certain years, but the time series is in general increasing over time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nvessels_ts <- rio::import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/Vessels_Trade_US.csv\") |> # ts1\n  mutate(\n    dates = dmy(date),\n    year = lubridate::year(date),\n    months = lubridate::month(date),\n    value = vessels\n  ) |> # ts2\n  dplyr::select(dates, year, months, value)  |> # ts3\n  arrange(dates) |> # ts4\n  mutate(index = tsibble::yearmonth(dates)) |> # ts5\n  as_tsibble(index = index) |> # ts6\n  dplyr::select(index, dates, year, months, value) |> # ts7\n  rename(Vessels = value) # rename value to emphasize data context\nvessels_ts |> #ts8\n  autoplot(.vars = Vessels) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"Vessels Cleared Monthly\",\n    title = \"Vessels Cleared Monthly in Foreing Trade for United Sates\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework_1_5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Question 2: Seasonally Adjusted Series - Calculation and Plot (10 points)\n\n#### a) Decompose the Vessels Cleared in Foreign Trade series using the multiplicative decomposition model.

We can research maritime events that could have impacted certain certain years of the vessel data, and reasoning that research using the multiplicative model will make the most sense. \n\n# The random component is taken by subtracting the trend and seasonally adjusted mean from any giving month in the index. By doing this, the random component takes into account seasons where vessel numbers could have been trending twice as much as they were the year before. Other events in the data that happen every year would be captured by the seasonally adjusted mean. For example we can argue that before the Christmas season, the number of vessels cleared would be higher then December and the first few months of the year. By doing this the random component tells us how random any giving month in the index is compared to the rest of the data. We can see in the plot of the multiplicative random component that the randomness is not much, and only stays between 0.8 and 1.2. \n\n# The additive random component plot shows the random component raging anywhere from -780 to 1000. We have months as low as 1659 vessels cleared with the highest month being 8475 vessels cleared. This is like trying to predict the number of vessels for next January will be 2000 (+-800). +-800 is a big difference. In contrast using the multiplicative model, the prediction can be 2000 (+-1). \n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n#### c) Please describe the differences between the random component series and use it as part of your justification for why we use the multiplicative decomposition model instead of the additive model to seasonally adjust the series.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\" icon=\"false\"}\nThe multiplicative decomposition model's random component supports insights given by the seasonal and trend assumptions. We can research maritime events that could have impacted certain years of the vessel data, and reasoning that research using the multiplicative model will make the most sense.\\\n\\\nThe random component is taken by subtracting the trend and seasonally adjusted mean from any given month in the index. By doing this, the random component considers seasons where vessel numbers could have been trending twice as much as they were the year before. The seasonally adjusted mean would capture other events in the data that happen every year. For example, we can argue that before the Christmas season, the number of vessels cleared would be higher than in December and the first few months of the year. Subtracting the trend (m_hat) and seasonally adjusted mean from any month in the index will result in the random component being a great metric to determined how random any given month in the index is compared to the rest of the data.
