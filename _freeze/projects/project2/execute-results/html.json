What Consumer Credit Data Are Available on the G.19 Statistical Release, \"Consumer Credit,\" and How Are These Data Calculated?**\n\nThe G.19 Statistical Release, \"Consumer Credit,\" reports outstanding credit extended to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures, excluding loans secured by real estate. Total consumer credit comprises two major types: revolving and nonrevolving. Revolving credit plans may be unsecured or secured by collateral and allow a consumer to borrow up to a prearranged limit and repay the debt in one or more installments. Credit card loans comprise most of revolving consumer credit measured in the G.19, but other types, such as prearranged overdraft plans, are also included. Nonrevolving credit is closed-end credit extended to consumers that is repaid on a prearranged repayment schedule and may be secured or unsecured. To borrow additional funds, the consumer must enter into an additional contract with the lender. Consumer motor vehicle and education loans comprise the majority of nonrevolving credit, but other loan types, such as boat loans, recreational vehicle loans, and personal loans, are also included.\n\nThe G.19 also reports selected terms of credit, including interest rates on new car loans, personal loans, and credit card plans at commercial banks. Historically, the G.19 also included series that measure the terms of credit for motor vehicle loans at finance companies. In the first quarter of 2011, publication of these series was temporarily suspended because of the deterioration of their statistical foundation. The statistical foundation is in the process of being improved, and publication will resume as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncredit <- rio::import(\"../data/debt.xlsx\") |>\n    mutate(ym = yearmonth(lubridate::ym(date)))\ndf <- as_tsibble(credit, index = ym) |>\n   select(ym, OCC, OCC_MoM) |>\n   mutate(OCC = OCC / 1000) |>\n   slice_head(prop = 1) # tail: last 10%. head: first or oldest\n#   slice((n() * 0.5):(n() * 0.6)) # select from 50% to 60%\n# interval(df) # gives interval: M, D ot Y etc\n# has_gaps(df) # false if none and vice versa True\n\n\np_cdebt <- df |> # fig 1\n  autoplot(OCC) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"OCC\",\n    title = \"Fig 1 - Time Series: OCC\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\np_cdebt_tail <- df |> # fig 1.1\n  slice_tail(prop = .1) |>\n  autoplot(OCC) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"OCC\",\n    title = \"fig 1.1 Time Series: OCC 2017-Present\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\np_cdebt_change <- df |>  # fig 1.2\n  autoplot(OCC_MoM) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Month\",\n    y = \"MoM OCC\",\n    title = \"Fig 1.2 - Time Series: OCC_MoM\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\np_cdebt | p_cdebt_tail\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](project2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fig 1.2\np_cdebt_change\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](project2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the time series of the Outstanding consumer debt.

This high and low peaks can be compared to peak holiday spending in the US, and normally the economy slows down a lot the first few months of the year. The MoMC automatically hits its low in January because the number of people taking out loans substantially decreases form December to January. January is a low, but the MoMC shows that the season starts to increase and would see a low dip in July which is the same low for OCC.

Evaluating Model Fit The sum of squared residuals (SSE) is a common\n    metric to evaluate how well the model fits the data. Lower SSE\n    values indicate that the model’s predictions are close to the actual\n    data points. In exponential smoothing models, you might compare SSEs\n    across different model configurations (e.g., different smoothing\n    parameters, different trend or seasonal components) to select the\n    model that minimizes error.\n\n2.  Optimization and Model Selection When fitting ETS models, you often\n    need to optimize parameters such as smoothing constants ( 𝛼 α, 𝛽 β,\n    and 𝛾 γ). The optimization criterion \"amse\" (average mean squared\n    error) minimizes the mean squared error, indirectly influencing SSE.\n    Comparing SSEs between models (df1 and df2 in your example) can help\n    you determine if adjusting a parameter (e.g., 𝛼 α from 0.1429622 to\n    0.2) results in a better model fit.\n\n3.  Diagnostics and Model Improvement SSE can be a diagnostic tool to\n    assess whether your chosen model structure (e.g., additive trend and\n    additive seasonality) is suitable for your data. High residual sums\n    (or unexplained variance) may suggest that the model lacks a\n    component (like an interaction between trend and seasonality) or is\n    mis-specified.\n\n4.  Statistical Properties of the Residuals For an ETS model to be\n    considered a good fit, residuals should ideally be white\n    noise—meaning they are uncorrelated, normally distributed, and have\n    zero mean. Analyzing the sum of squared residuals, along with\n    residual plots, autocorrelation, and partial autocorrelation\n    functions, provides insights into whether the residuals meet these\n    assumptions.\n\nIn short, the SSE (sum of squared residuals) is a key metric in\nexponential smoothing to measure and compare model performance, guide\nparameter optimization, and assess the statistical quality of the\nmodel's fit to time series data.\n\nspacer\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# mirror to resource code 3.4.2 \n\ndf342 <- df \n\n# autoplot(df342) +\n#

on. Like in the beginning OCC_MoM has a good amount of volatility, so the season is properly going down over time? \n * Okay I did cut the first 20 years of thge df so what will happen if I include the whole dataset. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=======\n>>>>>>> 41d67e11b64162a043bcde7f5be9624fcaf874ad\n",
