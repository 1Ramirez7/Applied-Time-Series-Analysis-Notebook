These reasons, combined with improved computing power, have made time series methods widely applicable in government, industry, and commerce.\n-   **Define time series**\n    -   Time series are analysed to understand the past and to predict the future, enabling managers or policy makers to make properly informed decisions.\n-   **Define sampling interval**\n    -   When a variable is measured sequentially in time over or at a fixed interval, known as the sampling interval, the resulting data form a time series.\n-   **Define serial dependence or autocorrelation**\n    -   A correlation of a variable with itself at different times is known as autocorrelation or serial correlation.\n-   **Define a time series trend**\n    -   In general, a systematic change in a time series that does not appear to be periodic is known as a trend. The simplest model for a trend is a linear increase or decrease, and this is often an adequate approximation.\n-   **Define seasonal variation**\n    -   Repeated pattern within each year (or any other fixed time period).\n-   **Define cycle**\n    -   Repeated pattern that does not correspond to some fixed natural period.\n-   **Differentiate between deterministic and stochastic trends**\n    -   Stochastic Trend: Random trend that does not follow a discernible or predictable pattern. @fig-stochastic\n    -   Deterministic Trend: Can be modeled with mathematical functions, facilitating the long-term prediction of the behavior. @fig-deterministic\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1.2: **Plot time series data to visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and potential outliers**</summary>\n\n-   Plot a \"ts\" object\n-   Plot the estimated trend of a time series by computing the mean across one full period\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1.3: **Decompose time series into trends, seasonal variation, and residuals**</summary>\n\n-   **Define smoothing**\n    -   The centred moving average is an example of a smoothing procedure that is applied retrospectively to a time series with the objective of identifying an underlying signal or trend.\n-   **Compute the centered moving average for a time series**\n    -   $\\hat m_t = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2}x_{t-6} + x_{t-5} + \\cdots + x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1} + \\cdot + x_{t+5} + \\frac{1}{2} x_{t+6}}{12}$.\n-   **Estimate the trend component using moving averages**\n    -   There are various ways to estimate the trend $m_t$ at time t, but a relatively simple procedure, is just use the cma formula for $x_t$. Orange line = CMA. @fig-cma\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1.3 **Plot time series data to visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and potential outliers**</summary>\n\n-   **Plot the estimated trend of a time series using a moving average.**\n-   **Make box plots to examine seasonality.**\n-   **Interpret the trend and seasonal pattern observed in a time series**\n    -   Trend is increasing over time, and there is a seasonal pattern that repeats every 12 months. The trend is estimated using a centred moving average, and the seasonal pattern is visualized using box plots. @fig-cma @fig-cmaboxplot\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1.4: **Use R to describe key features of time series data**</summary>\n\n-   Import CSV data and convert to tsibble format\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# Weather data for Rexburg\nmonthly_tsibble <- rio::import(\"https://byuistats.github.io/timeseries/data/rexburg_weather.csv\") |> \n  # Convert 'dates' to Date format\n  mutate(date2 = ymd(dates)) |>\n  # Extract year and month from 'date2'\n  mutate(year_month = yearmonth(date2)) |>\n  # Group data by 'year_month'\n  group_by(year_month) |>\n  # Calculate mean of 'rexburg_airport_high' for each group\n  summarize(average_daily_high_temp = mean(rexburg_airport_high)) |>\n  # Remove grouping\n  ungroup() |> \n  # Convert data frame to time series tibble\n  as_tsibble(index = year_month)\n\n # Display the resulting tibble\n view(monthly_tsibble) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>1.4: **Decompose time series into trends, seasonal variation, and residuals**</summary>\n\n-   **Implement additive decomposition**\n    -   A simple additive decomposition model is given by $x_t = m_t + s_t + r_t$, where $m_t$ is the trend, $s_t$ is the seasonal component, and $r_t$ (or in the book: where $z_t$ is an error term) is the random component. (1.5.2)\n-   **Explain how to remove seasonal variation using an estimate for seasonal component of a time series**\n    -   To remove the seasonal variation from a time series, we can subtract the estimated seasonal component from the original time series. This results in a seasonally-adjusted time series that can be used for further analysis.\n    -   It is common to present economic indicators, such as unemployment percentages, as seasonally adjusted series.This highlights any trend that might otherwise be masked by seasonal variation attributable, for instance, to the end of the academic year, when school and university leavers are seeking work. (1.5.3)\n-   **Compute the estimators of seasonal variation for an additive model**\n    -   $\\hat s_t$: The centered moving average, $\\hat m_t$, is then used to compute the monthly additive effect, $\\hat s_t$.\n\n    -   $\\bar {\\hat s_t}$: calculate the mean of the $\\hat s_t$ values for each month.

Each time series in the ensemble is a distinct realization of the model. For practical purposes, the ensemble represents the entire population of time series that share the same probability structure, even though we typically have access to only one observed realization in practice.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define the expected value (or mean function) of a time series model** (2.2.2)\n\nThe expected value of a time series model\n\nThe **expected value**, commonly abbreviated to expectation, E, of a variable, or a function of a variable, is its *mean* value in a population. So E(x) is the mean of x, denoted $\\mu$, and $$E[(x - \\mu)^2]$$ is the mean of the squared deviations about $\\mu$, better known as the variance $\\sigma^2$ of x. The standard deviation, $\\sigma$ is the square root of the variance.\n\n\n\nThe **mean function** of a time series model is, denoted $\\mu(t)$: $$\n\\mu(t) = E[x_t]\n$$ and, in general, is a function of t. The expectation in this definition is an average taken across the ensemble of all the possible time series that might have been produced by the time series model(see fig 2.2 in the book). The ensemble constitutes the entire population.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define the sample estimate of the population mean of a time series** (2.2.2 e2.7)\n\nThe **sample estimate** of the population mean is the arithmetic mean of the observed values in a single realization of the time series. It is calculated as: $$\n\\bar{x} =  \\sum_{t=1}^n \\frac{x_t}{n}\n$$ where $n$ is the number of observations. Equation (2.7) does rely on an assumption that a sufficiently long time series characterises the hypothetical model. Such models are known as [ergodic]{style=\"color:purple;\"}[^1], and the models in this book are all ergodic.\n\n[^1]: [A time series model that is stationary in the mean is ergodic in the mean if the time average for a single time series tends to the ensemble mean as the length of the time series increases (2.2 2.2.3).]{style=\"color:purple;\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define the variance function of a time series model** (2.2.1 2.2.4 e2.9)\n\nThe **variance function** of a time series model, denoted $\\sigma^2(t)$, that is stationary in the mean is $$\n\\sigma^2(t) = E[(x_t - \\mu)^2]\n$$ (is the mean of the squared deviations pdf pg 27)\n\nwhich can, in principle, take a different value at every time t. But we cannot estimate a different variance at each time point from a single time series. To progress, we must make some simplifying assumption. If we assume the model is stationary in the variance, this constant population variance, σ2, can be estimated from the sample variance\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **State the constant variance estimator for a time series model**\n\nThe constant variance estimator? not sure about this one $$\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{t=1}^n (x_t - \\bar{x})^2$$ \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Explain the stationarity assumption**\n\nA time series is said to be **stationary** if its statistical properties, such as the mean, variance, and autocorrelation, are constant over time. **Need to confirm this**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Explain the stationary variance assumption** (2.2.4 e2.9)\n\n**Not sure about this** \nThis can continue from the <span style=\"color:purple;\">Variance Function</span> in equation 2.9 to 2.10 maybe. \n\nThe variance function of a time series model that is stationary in the mean is which can, in principle, take a different value at every time t. But we cannot estimate a different variance at each time point from a single time series. To progress, we must make some simplifying assumption. If we assume the model is stationary in the variance, this constant population variance, σ2, can be estimated from the sample variance:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define lag**\n\n**Lag** refers to the time difference or the number of steps between two points in a time series. It is denoted by $k$ and often appears in contexts like autocorrelation or autocovariance calculations. For example: \n\n- Lag $k$ compares $x_t$ with $x_{t+k}$, where $k$ is the number of time steps separating the observations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define autocorrelation**\n\n**Autocorrelation** A correlation of a variable with itself at different times\nis known as <span style=\"color:purple;\">autocorrelation</span> or serial correlation.  If a time series model is second-order stationary, we can define an autocovariance function (acvf), $y_k$, as a function of the lag k. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Second-Order Properties**\n\nThe mean and variance play an important role in the study of statistical distributions because they summarise two key distributional properties– a central location and the spread. Similarly, in the study of time series models, a key role is played by the <span style=\"color:purple;\">second-order properties</span>, which include the mean, variance, and serial correlation (described below). \n\nConsider a time series model that is stationary in the mean and the variance. The variables may be correlated, and the model is second-order stationary if the correlation between variables depends only on the number of time steps separating them. The number of time steps between the variables is known as the lag. A correlation of a variable with itself at different times is known as autocorrelation or serial correlation. If a time series model is second-order stationary, we can define an <span style=\"color:purple;\">autocovariance function</span> (acvf), $y_k$, as a function of the lag $k$ (e2.11):\n\n$$\n\\gamma(k) = E[(x_t - \\mu)(x_{t+k} - \\mu)]\n$$\n\nThe function $\\gamma_k$ does not depend on t because the expectation, which is across the ensemble, is the same at all times t. This definition follows naturally from Equation (2.1) by replacing $x$ with $x_t$ and $y$ with $x_{t+k}$ and noting that the mean $\\mu$ is the mean of both $x_t$ and $x_{t+k}$. The lag $k$ <span style=\"color:purple;\">autocorrelation function</span> (acf), $p_k$, is defined by(e2.12)\n\n$$\n\\rho_k = \\frac{\\gamma_k}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\nIt follows from the definition that $p_0$ is 1. \n\nIt is possible to set up a second-order stationary time series model that has skewness; for example, one that depends on time t. Applications for such models are rare, and it is customary to drop the term ‘second-order’ and use ‘stationary’ on its own for a time series model that is at least second order stationary. The term <span style=\"color:pink;\">strictly stationary</span> is reserved for more rigorous conditions. The **acvf** and **acf** can be estimated from a time series by their sample equivalents. The sample **acvf**, $c_k$, is calculated as (e2.13)\n\n$$\nc_k = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} (x_t - \\bar{x})(x_{t+k} - \\bar{x}) \\tag{e2.13}\n$$\n\nNote that the autocovariance at lag 0, $c_0$, is the variance calculated with a denominator $n$. Also, a denominator $n$ is used when calculating $c_k$, although  only $n − k$ terms are added to form the numerator. Adopting this definition constrains all sample autocorrelations to lie between −1 and 1. The **sample acf** is defined as (e2.14)\n\n$$\nr_k = \\frac{c_k}{c_0}\n$$\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define the second-order stationary time series**\n\nA time series model is **second-order stationary** if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. The mean and variance are constant over time.\n\n2. The correlation between variables depends only on the lag $k$, which is the number of time steps separating them.\n\nThe **autocovariance function** (acvf), $\\gamma_k$, is defined as:\n\n- The **acvf**, $\\gamma_k$, quantifies the covariance between observations separated by a lag $k$, and it does not depend on the specific time $t$. This ensures the temporal consistency required for second-order stationarity: (e2.11)\n\n$$\n\\gamma(k) = E[(x_t - \\mu)(x_{t+k} - \\mu)]\n$$\n\nThe <span style=\"color:pink;\">**autocorrelation function**</span> (acf), $\\rho_k$, is: (e2.12)\n\n- The **acf**, $\\rho_k$, normalizes the autocovariance by the variance, providing a dimensionless measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between observations at lag $k$:\n\n$$\n\\rho_k = \\frac{\\gamma_k}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   **Define the autocovariance function, acvf**(2.2.5 e2.11)\n\nThe **acvf** quantifies the covariance between observations separated by a lag $k$, and it does not depend on the specific time $t$.
